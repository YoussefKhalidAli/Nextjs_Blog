Description: This is a simple blog website where users can view posts made and create their own. The website uses Nextjs for navigation, React Redux for state management, React Query for fetch requests, and Typescript for functionality.Â 

Instruction:

      Step 1: Download the project folder.
      Step 2: Unzip the folder
      Step 3: Navigate to the folder directory using a terminal
      Step 4: Run the following commands
              1: npm install
              2: npm run dev
      Step 5: Enjoy the project

Developer's note: The posts require an image to be uploaded. This web page transforms uploaded images to base64 and adds them to the posts. It is important to know that this is NOT a good practice, but since the project was made without a backend, this was the simplest way to add images. The best practice is to upload images to the project folder and then save the path to the post object, which is usually done in the backend. Please refer to another blog website made using MERN full-stack on this GitHub (https://github.com/YoussefKhalidAli/Blog-website) for a better understanding, but keep in mind that it is an old project, so the code might be a little messy.
